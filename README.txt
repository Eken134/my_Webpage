# PHP REST API – Hack Edition

A quick weekend project to experiment with building a REST API in PHP.  
The project uses simple **Basic Auth** for verification and returns data in **JSON format**.

### Features
- Basic Auth (username/password via HTTP header)
- `GET /get_latest` endpoint that returns the latest signal data
- `POST /post_data` endpoint that receives and stores new signal updates
- Clean JSON responses designed for the connected Android client

### Purpose
A spontaneous **“Saturday hack”** to test out some web technologies before building the corresponding Android client.
